# RunRabbitRun

A simple side-scrolling action game, I developed this game with [Niels Jeppesen](https://dk.linkedin.com/in/nielsjeppesen), a fellow student of mine. The goal was to see whether we could create and publish a game on Facebook in under a week. The game features procedurally generated levels, in 6 different settings (3 themes, each in day and night mode), as well as enemies, points and combo scoring.

The game itself is made in Java, the graphics drawn by me, and the Facebook integration done in PHP with a database backend. The Facebook integration includes simple statistics comparing your performance to that of your friends.

Unfortunately the game is no longer available on Facebook. However it can be played [here](http://www.lionfisk.com/rabbit/runrunrun.html), although without the Facebook integration.
